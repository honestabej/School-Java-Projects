	/* 1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
	 * 		- This means that software engineers should always create programs that have the best interest of the general public in mind.
	 * 		  An example of this would be not designing an app that would unknowingly track people's locations and send them to a company
	 * 		  in return for money.
	 * 
	 * 3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards 
	 * 				possible.
	 * 		- This means that software engineers should not cut corners and be lazy in order to finish a product more quickly or for cheaper.
	 * 		  For instance, an engineer shouldn't use a code that has known bugs in it for a product, just because he doesnt want to take the
	 * 		  time to create a new code. Although time and money must be taken into consideration, the quality must come first.
	 * 
	 * 4. JUDGMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
	 * 		- This means that an engineer should keep a high level of integrity and should not stoop to shady or dishonest practices in order 
	 * 		  to earn more money. For example, a software engineer should not accept a bribe from a company who wants him to include a code 
	 * 		  that extracts information on the user without them being aware.
	 * 
	 * 5. MANAGEMENT - Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of 
	 * 				   software development and maintenance.
	 * 		- This rule is for the engineers who find themselves in a leadership position. It basically means that if you are a leader on a 
	 * 		  project, you should create an environment that is enjoyable to work in and promotes honest and quality work. For example, do not 
	 * 		  create working conditions and standards that are so bad that your employees feel the need to cut corners.
	 * 
	 * 7. COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
	 * 		- This rule is asking you, as a software engineer, to respect the work that is being done by your fellow engineers. For example, if 
	 * 		  you have a co-worker who comes up with a really cool code, do not take it and credit it as your own idea, as it is taking away from
	 * 		  an accomplishment that your co-worker has achieved.
	 *
